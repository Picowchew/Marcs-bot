Notes about Discord's Audit Log
- No event is triggered when an entry is created
- Iteration through the entries occurs in reverse chronological order
- Does not record message deletions when:
    - Users delete their own messages
    - Bots delete messages
- Does not record the message IDs nor content of the deleted messages
- Upon message deletion for the same executor, target, and channel:
    - The very first time:
        - A new entry is created
    - Within 5 minutes of the entry's creation:
        - The entry's message deletion count increases
    - Else:
        - Yet another entry is created
- An increase in an entry's message deletion count does not change the ID of the entry
